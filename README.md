# SLPEngine
This is the Main API I am using for all my Plugins released on https://spigotmc.org/

None of my Plugins will run without this, so be sure to have it installed!

# Maven
If you are a Developer and want to use this API urself, you are 100% free to do so! Please don't claim any of my code as yours though.
